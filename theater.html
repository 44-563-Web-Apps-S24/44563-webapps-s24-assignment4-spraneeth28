        <h1>Praneeth Shanigaram does Chekov tonight.</h1>
        <h2>Ivanoff Act 4 By Anton Chekov</h2>
        <p>Enter LVOFF, looking at his watch.
        </p><br>
        <p>LVOFF. It is five o'clock. The ceremony must have begun. First the
            priest will bless them, and then they will be led to the church to be
            married. Is this how virtue and justice triumph? Not being able to rob
            Sarah, he has tortured her to death; and now he has found another victim
            whom he will deceive until he has robbed her, and then he will get rid
            of her as he got rid of poor Sarah. It is the same old sordid story.
            [A pause] He will live to a fine old age in the seventh heaven of
            happiness, and will die with a clear conscience. No, Ivanoff, it shall
            not be! I shall drag your villainy to light! And when I tear off that
            accursed mask of yours and show you to the world as the blackguard you
            are, you shall come plunging down headfirst from your seventh heaven,
            into a pit so deep that the devil himself will not be able to drag you
            out of it! I am a man of honour; it is my duty to interfere in such
            cases as yours, and to open the eyes of the blind. I shall fulfil my
            mission, and to-morrow will find me far away from this accursed
            place. [Thoughtfully] But what shall I do? To have an explanation
            with Lebedieff would be a hopeless task. Shall I make a scandal, and
            challenge Ivanoff to a duel? I am as excited as a child, and have
            entirely lost the power of planning anything. What shall I do? Shall I
            fight a duel?
        </p><br>
        <p>Enter KOSICH. He goes gaily up to LVOFF.
        </p><br>
        <p>KOSICH. I declared a little slam in clubs yesterday, and made a grand
            slam! Only that man Barabanoff spoilt the whole game for me again.
            We were playing--well, I said "No trumps" and he said "Pass." "Two in
            clubs," he passed again. I made it two in hearts. He said "Three in
            clubs," and just imagine, can you, what happened? I declared a little
            slam and he never showed his ace! If he had showed his ace, the villain,
            I should have declared a grand slam in no trumps!
        </p><br>
        <p>LVOFF. Excuse me, I don't play cards, and so it is impossible for me to
            share your enthusiasm. When does the ceremony begin?
        </p><br>
        <p>KOSICH. At once, I think. They are now bringing Zuzu to herself again.
            She is bellowing like a bull; she can't bear to see the money go.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            LVOFF. And what about the daughter?
        </p><br>
        <p>
            KOSICH. No, it is the money. She doesn't like this affair anyway. He is
            marrying her daughter, and that means he won't pay his debts for a long
            time. One can't sue one's son-in-law.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            MARTHA, very much dressed up, struts across the stage past LVOFF and
            KOSICH. The latter bursts out laughing behind his hand. MARTHA looks
            around.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            MARTHA. Idiot!
        </p><br>
        <p>
            KOSICH digs her in the ribs and laughs loudly.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            MARTHA. Boor!
        </p><br>
        <p>
            KOSICH. [Laughing] The woman's head has been turned. Before she fixed
            her eye on a title she was like any other woman, but there is no coming
            near her now! [Angrily] A boor, indeed!
        </p><br>
        <p>
            LVOFF. [Excitedly] Listen to me; tell me honestly, what do you think of
            Ivanoff?
        </p><br>
        <p>
            KOSICH. He's no good at all. He plays cards like a lunatic. This is what
            happened last year during Lent: I, the Count, Borkin and he, sat down to
            a game of cards. I led a----
        </p><br>
        <p>
            LVOFF [Interrupting him] Is he a good man?
